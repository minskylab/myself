# Myself

Myself is a Rust library for building conversational agents powered by OpenAI's language model. It provides a simple Agent abstraction to manage interactions and memory, making it easy to create natural language interfaces for various applications.

## A New Kind of Firmware

Myself can be thought of as a new kind of firmware for large language models. In traditional computing systems, firmware is software that is embedded in hardware devices to control their behavior. Similarly, Myself provides a layer of software abstraction that sits between the language model and the application, managing interactions and memory in a way that is efficient and reliable.

## Features

- Simple API for creating and managing conversational agents
- Efficient memory management for large language models
- Integration with OpenAI's API for easy access to cutting-edge language technology
